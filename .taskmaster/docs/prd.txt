Bookmark Validation and Enhancement Tool - Product Requirements Document

PRODUCT OVERVIEW:
A Windows command-line executable tool that processes raindrop.io bookmark exports to validate URLs, generate AI-enhanced descriptions, and create an optimized tagging system. The tool is designed for users with large bookmark collections (3,500+ items) who want to clean, enhance, and better organize their digital bookmarks without manual effort.

TARGET USERS:
- Power users with 1,000+ bookmarks using raindrop.io
- Digital researchers, academics, and information workers
- Users comfortable with command-line tools
- Windows 11 users

CORE REQUIREMENTS:

1. RAINDROP.IO FORMAT PROCESSING (Critical)
   - Import 11-column CSV files exported from raindrop.io (id, title, note, excerpt, url, folder, tags, created, cover, highlights, favorite)
   - Export 6-column CSV files for raindrop.io import (url, folder, title, note, tags, created)
   - Handle UTF-8 encoding and international characters
   - Preserve folder structure with forward slash notation
   - Format tags correctly (single unquoted, multiple quoted with commas)

2. URL VALIDATION WITH RETRY LOGIC (Critical)
   - Validate each bookmark URL by checking HTTP 200 status
   - Implement intelligent rate limiting per domain (0.5-3.0 seconds between requests)
   - Special handling for major sites (Google, GitHub, YouTube, LinkedIn, etc.)
   - Retry failed URLs later in the processing batch
   - Use realistic browser headers and user agent rotation
   - Maximum 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff
   - Continue processing despite individual URL failures

3. AI-ENHANCED DESCRIPTION GENERATION (Critical)
   - Generate AI descriptions using existing note/excerpt content as input context
   - Target description length: 100-150 characters
   - Fallback hierarchy: AI with existing content → existing excerpt → meta description → title-based description
   - Use transformer models (facebook/bart-large-cnn or equivalent)
   - Preserve user intent while enhancing with AI analysis

4. CORPUS-AWARE TAG OPTIMIZATION (Critical)
   - Analyze complete bookmark corpus after validation and description generation
   - Generate optimal tag set targeting 100-200 unique tags
   - Replace existing tags while using them as input context
   - Maximum 5 tags per bookmark
   - Ensure coherent tagging across similar content types
   - Perform final tag assignment after all processing is complete

5. CHECKPOINT AND RESUME FUNCTIONALITY (High Priority)
   - Save processing state every 50 processed items
   - Automatic checkpoint detection on startup
   - Resume processing from last successful checkpoint
   - Secure checkpoint file management with automatic cleanup
   - Include validation status, descriptions, and processing state in checkpoints

6. WINDOWS EXECUTABLE PACKAGING (Critical)
   - Single .exe file with embedded dependencies
   - No Python installation required on target system
   - Windows 11 compatibility
   - Proper resource path handling for executable environment
   - Model caching and management for AI components

7. PROGRESS TRACKING AND REPORTING (High Priority)
   - Real-time progress bars with percentage completion
   - Text updates describing current processing activity
   - Accurate time estimation for remaining work
   - Stage-specific progress indicators (validation, content analysis, AI processing, tagging)
   - Comprehensive error logging (console + file)
   - Detailed error log for invalid bookmarks

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
- Process 3,500+ bookmarks within 8 hours
- Peak memory usage < 4GB
- Maximum 10 concurrent network connections
- Application startup < 30 seconds
- Resume from checkpoint < 30 seconds

USER INTERFACE:
Command-line interface with argument parsing:
bookmark-processor.exe --input raindrop_export.csv --output enhanced_bookmarks.csv [options]

Options:
  --config CONFIG_FILE    Custom configuration file
  --resume               Resume from existing checkpoint
  --verbose              Enable detailed logging
  --batch-size SIZE      Processing batch size (default: 100)
  --max-retries NUM      Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)
  --clear-checkpoints    Clear existing checkpoints and start fresh
  --help                 Show help message

DATA QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- 95%+ processing completion rate for valid bookmarks
- All URLs must be unique in final output
- Descriptions must be concise and accurately represent content
- Tags must be relevant, optimized for the entire corpus, and properly formatted
- Error logs must provide sufficient detail for manual review

SECURITY AND PRIVACY:
- All processing is local - no external data transmission except to target URLs
- Secure handling of checkpoint files
- No sensitive information in logs
- Input validation for all user-provided data
- Protection against SSRF and malicious URLs

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Successfully validate and process 95%+ of accessible bookmarks
- Generate relevant, enhanced descriptions for all valid bookmarks
- Create optimized tag set that effectively categorizes the entire bookmark corpus
- Eliminate all duplicate URLs from the dataset
- Complete processing of 3,500+ bookmarks within 8-hour timeframe
- Maintain stable performance without memory leaks or crashes
- Provide accurate progress estimation and timing information
- 100% compatibility with raindrop.io import format

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Programming Language: Python 3.9+
- Application Type: Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Processing Method: Batch processing with checkpoint/resume capability
- Packaging: PyInstaller for Windows executable creation
- Key Dependencies: pandas, requests, beautifulsoup4, transformers, tqdm, pytest

FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS:
- Support for other bookmark export formats (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Advanced tag categorization and hierarchical organization
- Content similarity detection and recommendation features
- Parallel processing optimization for faster completion
- GUI version for less technical users
