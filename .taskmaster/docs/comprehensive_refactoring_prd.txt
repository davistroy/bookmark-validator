# Bookmark Validator Technical Debt Elimination and Feature Completion PRD

## Project Overview

The Bookmark Validation and Enhancement Tool is a Python CLI application designed to process raindrop.io bookmark exports, validate URLs, generate AI descriptions, and apply intelligent tagging. This PRD outlines a comprehensive refactoring initiative to eliminate technical debt, implement missing features, and achieve production-ready quality.

## Current State Analysis

### Critical Issues Identified
- Platform support contradiction (Linux/WSL only vs Windows executable claims)
- Missing core feature implementations (Cloud AI, corpus-aware tagging, cost tracking)
- Over-engineered configuration system (42 options across 7 sections)
- Architecture anti-patterns (god objects, high coupling, parallel data stores)
- Significant testing gaps (31 modules without test coverage)
- Documentation-implementation misalignment
- Security vulnerabilities (insufficient SSRF protection, input validation)
- Performance bottlenecks (memory inefficient, no streaming processing)

### Technical Debt Assessment
- **Configuration complexity**: 90% reduction needed (42 → 15 options)
- **Architecture issues**: 80% improvement required (god object elimination)
- **Testing coverage**: 70% gaps in critical security/performance areas
