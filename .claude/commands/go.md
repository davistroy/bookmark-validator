Use any/all tools and mcp servers available to you, prioritizing using context7 mcp and any OFFICIAL documentation you need, to execute these steps - read and understand all of the below steps before embarking on the journey:
1. Carefully study the overall plan and what has been completed so far AND any errors, failures, or issues you are aware of in this project and determine recommended next steps.  
2. Be sure to ALWAYS keep the plan in sync, with extensive comments, with what has been accomplished and what the next steps are. 
3. Being extremely self aware to make sure you do not get into loops, fully implement the rest of the plan, one step at a time, reviewing CLAUDE.md before you begin each step.  If any steps is taking longer than five minutes or f you get into a loop (where you find you are executing the same set of task(s) more than three times in a row), stop, take a step back and re-evaluate what you are doing.  Make sure you are checking the latest official documentation with context7 at all times.
4. Mark all steps in the plan with the appropriate status as you move along - be sure to keep the plan in sync with the actual state of the development.  Be verbose as you move along, describing the details of what you are doing.  
5. Stop if you get into a loop, encounter a failure or problem, or need to take a step back and evaluate where you are.
6. Otherwise, do not stop until all phases/tasks/steps are complete.  
7. BE SURE TO STRICTLY FOLLOW THE RULES IN CLUADE.md!  DO NOT STUB OUT OR PUT IN PLACEHOLDER CODE OR COMMENTS - FULLY IMPLEMENT!
8. Fully test all code and fix all errors and warnings before proceeding - do not jump to conclusions, evaluate all errors together as a group and do thorough research before fixing anything, implement permanent fixes STRICTLY FOLLOWING CLAUDE.md ... keep testing and fixing until there are NO errors and NO warnings.  Make sure you are checking the latest official documentation with context7 at all times.
9. Now go back and evaluate exactly what you did against what you said you have completed - do not lie to yourself.  Be honest if you have not completed a task.
10. Update any docs in the docs folder to reflect the latest configuration - always keep the docs in sync with the code
11. clean up any temporary files in the project - keep the project folders and files clean
12. Update README.md
13. Commit to git and push to github - do not forget or skip this step!
14. check all github actions and make sure they are all error free.  Fully test all code and fix all errors and warnings before proceeding - do not jump to conclusions, evaluate all errors together as a group and do thorough research before fixing anything, implement permanent fixes STRICTLY FOLLOWING CLAUDE.md ... keep testing and fixing until there are NO errors and NO warnings.  Make sure you are checking the latest official documentation with context7 at all times.
15. Return to step 0 above and continue through all steps repeatedly until the project is complete
