Use any/all tools and mcp servers available to you, prioritizing using context7 mcp and any OFFICIAL documentation you need, to execute these steps:
1. Carefully study the overall plan and what has been completed so far AND any errors, failures, or issues you are aware of in this project and determine recommended next steps.  Be sure to ALWAYS keep the plan in sync, with extensive comments, with what has been accomplished and what the next steps are. Fully implement the rest of the plan, one step at a time, reviewing CLAUDE.md before you begin each step.
2. Mark all steps in the plan with the appropriate status as you move along - be sure to keep the plan in sync with the actual state of the development.  Be verbose as you move along, describing the details of what you are doing.  Stop if you encounter a failure or problem you cannot solve, otherwise do not stop until all phases/tasks/steps are complete.  BE SURE TO STRICTLY FOLLOW THE RULES IN CLUADE.md!
3. Fully test all code and fix all errors and warnings before proceeding - do not jump to conclusions, evaluate all errors together as a group and do thorough research before fixing anything, implement permanent fixes STRICTLY FOLLOWING CLAUDE.md ... keep testing and fixing until there are NO errors and NO warnings.
4. Update any docs in the docs folder to reflect the latest configuration - always keep the docs in sync with the code
5. clean up any temporary files in the project - keep the project folders and files clean
6. Update README.md
7. Commit to git and push to github - do not forget or skip this step!
8. Return to step 0 above and continue through all steps repeatedly until the project is complete
