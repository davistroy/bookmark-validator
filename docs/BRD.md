## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the business requirements for developing a Python-based command-line tool that processes bookmark exports from raindrop.io. The tool will validate bookmark URLs, generate AI-powered descriptions, and assign relevant tags to enhance bookmark organization and usability. The final deliverable will be a standalone Windows 11 executable file.

## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 Purpose
Create an automated Windows executable tool to process and enhance bookmark collections by validating URLs, generating concise descriptions using AI and existing content, and applying intelligent tagging for better organization.

### 2.2 Scope
The tool will process CSV exports from raindrop.io (11-column format), validate each bookmark's accessibility, generate enhanced descriptions using AI and existing content, apply intelligent tagging, and output enhanced bookmark data in raindrop.io compatible 6-column CSV import format.

### 2.3 Objectives
- Validate bookmark accessibility and remove dead links
- Generate enhanced AI-powered descriptions using existing content as input
- Apply intelligent content-based tagging to replace existing tags
- Eliminate duplicate URLs
- Provide comprehensive progress tracking with checkpoint/resume functionality
- Deliver as standalone Windows executable requiring no Python installation

- Descriptions shall be concise and informative (target: 100-150 characters)
- The system shall use transformer models for AI summarization

**FR-06: Tag Assignment**
- The system shall completely replace existing tags with AI-generated tags
- Existing tags may be used as input context for AI tag generation
- Flexible tag limits based on corpus analysis (guideline: aim for ~100-200 unique tags)
- Tags shall use quoted format required by raindrop.io import: "tag1, tag2, tag3"
- Final tag assignment shall be performed after all validation and description generation is complete

### 3.4 Progress Management
**FR-07: Checkpoint and Resume Functionality**
- The system shall save progress incrementally during processing
- The system shall support resuming from interruption points
- Checkpoint files shall include validation status, descriptions, and processing state
- The system shall detect and resume from existing checkpoint files automatically

**FR-08: Output Generation**
- The system shall export valid, enhanced bookmarks in 6-column raindrop.io import format
- Output columns: url, folder, title, note, tags, created (only required columns)
- Invalid bookmarks shall be logged separately with error details
- Final tag optimization shall occur after all processing is complete
